# wait before following these instructions
# working on a git clone and moving through the installation instructions on GitHub

# verify biobert_pytorch/datasets is in the .gitignore (should be at the bottom under "# pytorch and biobert files")
- go to https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert-pytorch

# using the download.sh:
- in terminal:
    - cd biobert_pytorch
    - curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmis-lab/biobert-pytorch/master/download.sh
    - chmod +x download.sh (this changes permissions so you can download)
    - sh download.sh or ./download.sh (this downloads)

# if the above displays an error:
- under installation click "here" (takes you to google drive)
- a folder named datasets will be visible
- in the top-right section, click download
- to extract files, from terminal:
    - only run one of the follow commands:
        - "tar -xf filename.tar.gz", "tar -xvf filename.tar.gz", or "tar -xzvf datasets.tar.gz" (for flag meanings, in terminal: tar -h)
    - rm filename.tar.gz
