# verify */NER, */QA, and */RE are in the .gitignore (should be at the bottom under "# pytorch and biobert files")
- go to https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert-pytorch

# using the download.sh:
- cd biobert_pytorch_datasets
- curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmis-lab/biobert-pytorch/master/download.sh
- chmod +x download.sh (this changes permissions so you can download)
- sh download.sh or ./download.sh (this downloads)

# if the above displays an error for wget:
- under installation click "here" (takes you to google drive)

- then move NER, QA, and RE folders into biobert_pytorch_datasets folder
