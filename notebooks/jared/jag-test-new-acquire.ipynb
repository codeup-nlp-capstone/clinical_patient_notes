He has no notable PMH and presented today with palpitations that have been occurring sporadically for 2-3 months.  He started college 7-8 months ago and described feelings of nervousness and anxiousness with starting school and exams.  He endorses using his roommates prescription adderall to study for tests and this coincides with the palpitations at times.  Nothing makes his palpitations worse or better when they occur.  ROS is negative except for light headedness and SOB.  He has not had any cold/heat intolerance, diarrhea, changes in voiding habits, or weight loss.
